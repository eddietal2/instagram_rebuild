Learning Swift and iOS Development by recreating Instagram via Tutorial

For an Upcoming program I have to teach, the curriculum involves Swift and iOS Development for Cody High School.
I am teaching myself how to build an iOS application by recreating Instagram. At this point (November 22, 2021), I am primarily a Web Developer so this is a new skill set I am learning. I love Apple Products so I am excited learn and teach!

This is the tutorial I am using:
